# CSS 
## Visual Studio Code - MarkDown Preview

This css file extends the vscode MarkDown preview with a hierarchical numbering of the headings.
Starting at level 2 (`##`) to allow titles as level 1.

## Installation
### Filesystem

Add the relative path to `markdonw-numbering.css` file in the settings:  
  File > Preferences > Settings > Markdown: Styles

_vscode restriction (state 2024/01/01):_ It is not possible to set an absolute path, so the css file must be copied to each workspace: 
> A list of URLs or local paths to CSS style sheets to use from the Markdown preview. Relative paths are interpreted relative to the folder open in the Explorer. If there is no open folder, they are interpreted relative to the location of the Markdown file. All '\' need to be written as '\\'.

Alternativly you can use the web page setting
